Dog Breed Identification

This project aims to classify dog images into different breeds using deep learning techniques. The dataset used for this project is the Dog Breed Identification competition on Kaggle. It contains a large collection of labeled dog images from various breeds.
Dataset

The dataset consists of the following files:

    `train.zip`: A compressed archive containing the training set images. Each image is labeled with a breed ID.
    `test.zip`: A compressed archive containing the test set images. The goal is to predict the breed of these images.
    `labels.csv`: A CSV file containing the mapping between breed IDs and their corresponding labels.

Dependencies

The project requires the following dependencies:

    Python 3.x
    TensorFlow
    Keras
    NumPy
    Pandas
    Matplotlib

Model

The model architecture used in this project is a convolutional neural network (CNN). It consists of several convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.
The model achieved an accuracy of 99.82% on the validation set.
